# BookingProject
A desktop application created in Java. Booking is designed for two types of users: owners of hotels or other forms of rental units and clients. 
Owners can add their accommodation unit to the application and manage its profile. 
Clients can enter the date and location of their trip and view the available options and leave reviews after staying at a certain unit.
Users can also send messages to each other using the application's chat. 
As a non-functional requirement, the security part was an aspect that we always had in mind in the design of this project.
Github has been an important aspect of our collaboration as a group. Booking was designed using the Client-Server architecture.
Technologies: Java Swing for GUI, JPA for persistence, Hibernate, PostgreSQL.
